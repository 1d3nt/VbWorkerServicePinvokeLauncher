# VbWorkerServicePinvokeLauncher
This project is a .NET 8.0 Worker Service built-in Visual Basic (VB), designed to launch and manage processes under specific user accounts, such as the SYSTEM account, by duplicating process tokens. It uses P/Invoke to interact with Windows APIs, enabling processes to start with elevated privileges or different user contexts.
